      <Section icon={faBook}  title="Our Story">
      Our platform was inspired by a common challenge in software development : handling tricky edge cases. <br/>As a developer, I often faced unexpected bugs and unreliable code. I wanted to create a space where developers could easily tackle these issues and write stronger, more reliable code. 
      My goal is to make coding easier and more intuitive, especially for those just starting out.

        What began as a simple idea has grown into a comprehensive tool that supports interactive coding challenges and real-time
